# Your Average Duels Serverâ„¢

**Blah blah blah, typical duels rules- just don't be a dumbass. If you have an issue with a player start a votekick.**
*If there is a player in the server with moderator privileges and they see disruptive behavior- they'll remove the member from the server.*

### Want a quieter place to duel or interested in 2v2 or 3v3 fights?
I've got a skirmish server setup to where if you're looking for a quieter or more organized place- that's probably the place you'll want to go to.
- Server Name: YADs Skirmish (128 tick)
- 12MB worth of mods, these are Steedie's maps.
